This is an absolutely minimal Hello World application for Electron built from the Electron Quick Start Tutorial here:

[http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/)

This app starts up in a window, displays some simple text, shows the standard Chrome dev tools and has no menus, quit button, etc.  All of that will come in a later version of the tutorial.

I wrote this due to major problems following other Electron tutorials.  Examples:

* https://www.sitepoint.com/desktop-node-apps-with-electron/ -- the Marvel apis it relies on don't seem to exist as you don't seem to be able to get the API key
* http://www.codeblocq.com/2016/06/Build-your-First-Electron-App/ -- the Window doesn't actually display

Overall Electron is changing very rapidly and the Internet is fluid which makes detailed tutorials challenging.

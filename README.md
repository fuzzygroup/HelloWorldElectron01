This is an absolutely minimal Hello World application for Electron built from the Electron Quick Start Tutorial here:

[http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/quick-start/)

This app starts up in a window, displays some simple text, shows the standard Chrome dev tools and has no menus, quit button, etc.  All of that will come in a later version of the tutorial.
